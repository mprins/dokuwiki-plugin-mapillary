**This plugin is currently broken as Mapillary discontinued their embedding widget and the underlying API. The new API relies on WebGL and requires considerable hardware resources.**
Please use the iframe plugin with the embedding options that Mapillary provides [http://blog.mapillary.com/update/2016/11/30/embed-mapillary.html]
